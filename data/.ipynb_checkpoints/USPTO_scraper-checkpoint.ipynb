       " 'descriptionText': ['This invention relates to moisture traps, and more particularly to lightweight portable moisture traps for use with vacuum pumps.It is sometimes necessary to evacuate moist air from equipment such as chambers or vessels. For example, a vacuum pump can be used to evacuate air from a chamber containing a moist or wet object. However, if moist air is pulled into a vacuum pump, it can negatively impact the efficiency of the pump and reduce the lifetime of the pump.In the construction industry, vacuum pumps can be used in the testing of paving materials. By way of example, compacted asphalt samples are tested using ASTM Test D2726, ASTM Test D6752, and AASHTO Test T166. These tests require the determination of the density of the materials. This requires that the dry mass of a sample along with a sample volume be determined in order to calculate the density, which is the ratio of the mass to the volume. Moisture may be introduced into the sample by the cutting process or may be naturally present in the sample. As described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2005/0102851, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, a vacuum pump can be used to remove moisture from a chamber holding the sample to thereby dry the sample.By way of further example, vacuum pumps can be used in tests to determine the maximum specific gravity and density of bituminous paving mixtures, such as the tests described in ASTM Test D2041 and AASHTO Test T209. In these tests, a sample of known dry weight is placed in a vessel. Water is then introduced into the vessel to submerge the sample, and the vacuum pump evacuates air to reduce the pressure in the vessel. The volume of the sample is then determined, and the density or specific gravity of the sample can be determined based on the dry weight and the volume of the sample.As seen from these examples, the vacuum pump may evacuate moist air from the chamber or vessel. The evacuated moist air will enter the vacuum pump unless it is dried prior to reaching the pump. Vacuum pumps use lubricants (e.g., oil) to reduce friction between moving parts and to protect seals. However, when moisture enters the vacuum pump, the moisture mixes with the oil and reduces its effectiveness. Thus, moisture will eventually destroy the vacuum pump. Frequent oil changes may prolong the life of the pump, but the oil changes can frustrate the user by increasing cost and creating downtime, and can also produce considerable waste.Therefore, users sometimes attempt to dry the air before it enters the pump. Indeed, the aforementioned ASTM Test D2041 and AASHTO Test T209 require the use of one or more in-line dryers to reduce moisture entering the vacuum pump. Current practice is to use one or more desiccant air dryers positioned between the equipment containing moist air and the vacuum pump.However, there are numerous drawbacks to the use of presently used in-line dryers, such as desiccant dryers. First, desiccant dryers can introduce considerable air flow resistance, thereby increasing the power consumed by the vacuum pump and decreasing its efficiency.Moreover, desiccant dryers can be inefficient with regard to their moisture-removing characteristics. The dryers tend to be most efficient when the desiccants are dry. Thus, the dryers will either lose their efficiency during use or will create downtime while waiting for the desiccants to dry. The dryers could be replaced or recycled during use, but this increases cost and also creates downtime.Desiccant dryers have a limited lifetime, and need to be replaced or recycled periodically. Again, this increases cost and creates downtime. The continual replacement also produces waste. Furthermore, a user may neglect to timely replace the dryers, which can decrease the efficiency and reduce the life of the vacuum pump.Thus, the current use of desiccant dryers can be environmentally unfriendly. The dryers increase air flow resistance and can allow moisture into the vacuum pump, which can increase the necessary power consumed by the pump. Moisture entering the pump also reduces the efficiency of the lubricant or oil in the pump, necessitating an increased number of waste-creating oil changes. Finally, because the desiccant dryers inevitably allow moisture to enter the vacuum pump, the life of the vacuum pump is decreased, sometimes substantially. The result can be the early disposal and replacement of pumps.Therefore, there may be a need for an apparatus that will effectively dry air evacuated from equipment before the air enters the vacuum pump, and will do so without overly restricting air flow. There may be a need for an apparatus that will perform effective drying continuously to minimize downtime. Finally, there may be a need for an environmentally friendly solution that can increase the lifetime of vacuum pumps and generally reduce waste.As a first aspect, a portable moisture trap for use with a vacuum pump includes: a housing; a cooling chamber positioned at least partially within the housing including a first inlet port and a second outlet port; a lid that sealably attaches to a top portion of the cooling chamber to seal the cooling chamber; a heat sink residing under the cooling chamber; a thermoelectric device having an upper cooling side and a lower heat generating side residing between the cooling chamber and the heat sink; a fan residing under the heat sink, the fan being oriented to blow air upwardly toward the heat sink; and a baffle extending downwardly in the cooling chamber from a location proximate the lid to a location proximate an inner bottom surface of the cooling chamber. The thermoelectric device is in thermal communication with the cooling chamber and oriented so that the cooling side faces the cooling chamber and the heat generating side faces and is in thermal communication with the heat sink. The baffle is configured to define a physical barrier to urge air received through the first port to flow down toward the inner bottom surface of the cooling chamber before exiting through the second port, to thereby remove moisture from air traveling through the cooling chamber in response to a vacuum pump in fluid communication with the second port.In some embodiments, the baffle includes a plate that extends across the cooling chamber so that the first port is on one side of the plate and the second port is on the other side of the plate. The plate has a bottom edge with alternating downward projections and valleys that resides proximate the inner bottom surface of the cooling chamber.As a second aspect, a method of determining the maximum specific gravity or density of a sample of paving mixture includes: providing a portable moisture trap in a fluid path connecting a vessel adapted to hold a test sample and a vacuum pump, wherein the portable moisture trap includes a cooling chamber having a first port connected to the vessel and a second port connected to the vacuum pump, and wherein the portable moisture trap further includes a thermoelectric device; cooling the cooling chamber of the portable moisture trap using the thermoelectric device; weighing the test sample to determine a dry mass of the sample; placing the test sample in the vessel; adding water to the vessel to submerge the test sample; then evacuating moist air from the vessel while the test sample is submerged using the vacuum pump; then determining a volume of the test sample; and calculating the density and/or the maximum specific gravity of the test sample using the determined dry mass and the determined volume of the sample. The evacuating step is carried out by: flowing the moist air from the vessel through the first port of the cooling chamber; then removing moisture from the moist air in the cooling chamber; and then flowing substantially dry air through the second port of the cooling chamber toward the vacuum pump.In some embodiments, determining the volume of the sample includes: submerging the vessel with the test sample in a water bath; and determining an underwater weight of the test sample.

The fan  may be attached to a bracket  (for example, with bolts, rods, or the like), and the bracket  may be attached to the housing . The bracket  may include an aperture () through which air may flow. It is noted that the bracket is optional and the fan  may be situated under the heat sink  in other ways (for example, the fan  may be directly mounted to the housing ). It is further noted that the fan need not be in a horizontal configuration. For example, the fan may be oriented vertically, or at any angle between horizontal and vertical, and duct work may direct air flow toward the heat sink  and/or the elongated fins .In some embodiments, the housing  includes a sidewall having a cutaway (). The cutaway has a size sufficient to expose at least a major portion of a length of the downwardly extending fins  to environmental conditions. The cutaway can improve airflow and enhance heat transfer away from the heat sink .The cutaway can also allow for sufficient intake of environmental air to the fan . Additionally or alternatively, sidewalls of the housing  can include apertures  () can allow for sufficient intake of air to the fan .As understood by those of skill in the art, the temperature of the cooling side of the thermoelectric device  decreases as more heat is dissipated from the heat generating side of the thermoelectric device . Therefore, as the heat generating side is in thermal communication with the heat sink , increased heat transfer away from the heat sink  will result a colder cooling side of the thermoelectric device .The moisture trap  includes a baffle configured define a physical barrier to urge air received from one of the ports ,  to flow down toward the inner bottom surface  of the cooling chamber  before exiting through the other of the ports , , as will be described in more detail below. The baffle may comprise piping, mesh material, one or more plates, or one or more chambers within the interior of the cooling chamber .is a top view of the moisture trap  according to some embodiments of the invention. As illustrated, a baffle  extends downwardly in the cooling chamber  from a location proximate the lid  (or the top portion of the chamber ) to a location proximate an inner bottom surface  of the cooling chamber . The baffle  can be a plate sized and configured to extend across the cooling chamber  such that the first port  is on one side of the baffle  and the second port  is on the opposite side of the baffle . In some embodiments, the baffle  may contact opposing corners or sidewalls of the cooling chamber .The cooling chamber  can be substantially square or rectangular. The first and second sides or sidewalls , of the cooling chamber  can be substantially parallel. The cooling chamber can include third and fourth sides or sidewalls , attached to the first and second sides , , and the third and fourth sidewalls , can be substantially parallel. The first port  may extend through one sidewall and the second port  may extend through an opposing sidewall. For example, as illustrated in , the first port  may extend through the first sidewall of the cooling chamber  and the second port  may extend through the opposing second sidewall of the cooling chamber.As illustrated in , the baffle  may extend diagonally across the cooling chamber  and contact opposing corners or sidewalls. As illustrated, the baffle  extends from or adjacent a corner defined by sidewalls , to or adjacent a corner defined by sidewalls , . In some other embodiments, the baffle  may extend diagonally from or adjacent a corner defined by sidewalls , to or adjacent a corner defined by sidewalls , . In any event, the baffle  can be sized and configured to fit within the cooling chamber  such that the first port  is on one side of the baffle  and the second port  is on the opposite side of the baffle .are top views illustrating port and baffle configurations according to some other embodiments of the invention. For example, the first and second ports ,  may extend through the same sidewall of the cooling chamber  as illustrated in . In the illustrated embodiment, the first and second ports ,  extend through the first sidewall and the baffle  is sized and configured to extend across the cooling chamber  and contact opposing sidewalls , such that the first port  is on one side of the baffle  and the second port  is on the opposite side of the baffle . The ports ,  can also both extend through any of sidewalls , , , and the baffle  can be sized and configured to contact opposing sidewalls such that the first port  is on one side of the baffle  and the second port  is on the opposite side of the baffle .In some other embodiments, the first port  may extend through one sidewall of the cooling chamber  and the second port  may extend through an adjacent sidewall of the cooling chamber . As illustrated in , the first port  may extend through the first sidewall of the cooling chamber and the second port  may extend through the adjacent third sidewall of the cooling chamber  (it will be understood that the ports ,  may extend through any adjacent sidewalls). As illustrated and as described above in reference to , the baffle  can extend diagonally across the cooling chamber  and can be sized and configured to fit within the cooling chamber  such that the first port  is on one side of the baffle  and the second port  is on the opposite side of the baffle .It will be understood that the ports ,  may be at the same or substantially the same vertical level or elevation (e.g., relative to the ground or the inner bottom surface  of the cooling chamber ), or may be at different vertical levels or elevations.It will further be understood that, although not illustrated, one or both of the ports ,  may extend through the top of the cooling chamber  (e.g., through or adjacent the lid ) and/or one or both of the ports ,  may extend through the bottom of the cooling chamber  (e.g., through the inner and/or outer bottom surfaces , ).is a side view of the baffle  according to some embodiments of the invention. The baffle  has a bottom edge with alternating downward projections  and valleys  (i.e., openings between the projections). At least some of the projections  (and perhaps all of the projections , or all of the projections  aside from the outermost projections ) can have a width of about 1 inch. At least some of the valleys  (and perhaps all of the valleys ) can have a width of about 0.47 inches. At least some of the valleys  (and perhaps all of the valleys ) can have a height of about 0.35 inches.The baffle  can be slidably inserted into the interior of the cooling chamber , as shown in . When inserted, the bottom edge of the baffle  resides proximate the inner bottom surface  of the cooling chamber . Opposing sides of the baffle and/or interior corners of the cooling chamber  may be rounded to facilitate insertion of the baffle  into the chamber . In some other embodiments, the interior of the chamber  may include grooves (not shown) to facilitate insertion of the baffle . Alternatively, the baffle  may be integrated with the interior of the chamber . The baffle  may be a corrosion-resistant metal plate (e.g., aluminum or stainless steel) and may have a thickness of between about 0.032 inches to about 0.25 inches.Referring again to , in some embodiments, the moisture trap  may include a spacer block  positioned between the cooling side of the thermoelectric device  and an outer bottom surface  of the cooling chamber . As will be described in more detail below, the spacer block  can be used on top of the thermoelectric device  to help isolate the cooling chamber  from the heat generating side of the thermoelectric device . Furthermore, as will be described in more detail below, insulation can be placed proximate the spacer block  to help further isolate the cooling chamber  from the heat generating side of the thermoelectric device  and/or the heat sink .Therefore, in some embodiments, the heat sink , the thermoelectric device , the spacer block , and the cooling chamber  can comprise a stackable assembly as illustrated. The assembly or stack can be tightened together firmly to attain good surface-to-surface contact and enhance thermal transfer. The cooling chamber  may be firmly attached to the spacer block  in a manner known to those of ordinary skill in the art. By way of example, one or more fasteners  (e.g., screws) may penetrate through the chamber , spacer block , and into apertures (e.g., threaded apertures) in the heat sink  (). Vacuum sealing washers  may also be used as illustrated (). Moreover, thermally conductive paste and/or film may be applied or positioned between the heat sink  and the heat generating side of the thermoelectric device , between the cooling side of the thermoelectric device  and a bottom surface of the spacer block , and/or between an top surface of the spacer block  and the outer bottom surface  of the cooling chamber  to further enhance thermal transfer. Exemplary foil is available from Graphite Foil Fabricators Corp. in Plantsville, Conn. Exemplary paste is available from Arctic Silver Corp. in Visalia, Calif.As illustrated in , the thermoelectric device  can have a cross-sectional area that is less than a cross-sectional area of the spacer block , and the thermoelectric device  can have a thickness that is less than a thickness of the spacer block . Also as illustrated, the spacer block  can have a cross-sectional area that is less than a cross-sectional area of the cooling chamber  (i.e., the area of the outer bottom surface  of the cooling chamber ). In some embodiments, the thermoelectric device  is substantially centered above the heat sink , the spacer block  is substantially centered above the thermoelectric device , and/or the cooling chamber  is substantially centered above the spacer block .The thermoelectric device  can have a surface area (e.g., on the cooling side ) that is less than about 2.5 square inches and can be less than about 0.25 inches thick (or, in some embodiments, less than about 0.15 inches thick). The spacer block  can have a surface area (e.g., on the bottom surface ) that is less than about 4 square inches and can be less than about 0.75 inches thick (or, in some embodiments, less than about 0.5 inches thick). The outer bottom surface  of the cooling chamber  can have a surface area of less than about 15 square inches. More particularly, the cooling chamber  can have cross-sectional dimensions of about 4 inches by about 3.5 inches. The cooling chamber  can have a height of between about 1 inch to about 5 inches. Thus, the cooling chamber  can have an internal volume of about 14 cubic inches to about 70 cubic inches. These relatively small component dimensions allow for a lightweight and portable design, as described in more detail below.A first insulating material  can snugly surround downwardly extending perimeter sides  of the spacer block . In some embodiments, the insulating material  is a gasket, with an upper portion of the gasket  directly contacting the outer bottom surface  of the cooling chamber  and a lower portion of the gasket  directly contacting an upper surface of the heat sink . The insulating material  can be foam rubber, such as polyurethane foam, foam rubber latex, and the like. In the illustrated embodiment, the spacer block  has a larger surface area than the thermoelectric device , thereby forming gaps or spaces  between the spacer block  and the heat sink . The insulating material or gasket  can be formed to fill the gaps . Alternatively, the gaps  may remain open or may be filled with additional insulating material.The first insulating material  can further thermally isolate the cooling chamber  from the heat generating side of the thermoelectric device  and the heat sink . In some embodiments, the insulating material  contacts the outer bottom surface  of the cooling chamber  and extends outwardly to the first and second sides or sidewalls , and/or to the third and fourth sides or sidewalls , of the cooling chamber . In this regard, the spacer block  and the insulating material  can serve to help thermally isolate the outer bottom surface  of the cooling chamber  from the thermoelectric device  and the heat sink . In some embodiments, the insulating material  is less than about 3 inches thick and, in some embodiments, less than about 2.5 inches thick.As seen in , the cooling chamber  can be spaced apart from sidewalls of the housing . In some embodiments, the heat sink  has a larger surface area than the surface area of the outer bottom surface  of the cooling chamber . For example, the heat sink  may extend proximate sidewalls of the housing . Therefore, it may be desirable to further insulate the cooling chamber  from the exposed portions of the heat sink  (e.g., those portions not thermally isolated from the cooling chamber  by the first insulating material ).illustrates the moisture trap  with the top portion of the housing  removed according to some embodiments. A second insulating material  can be positioned between the first and second sidewalls , of the cooling chamber  and the housing . The second insulating material  may be the same as the first insulating material  or may be different. In some embodiments, the second insulating material  comprises fiberglass. The second insulating material  can extend downwardly along the entire first and second sidewalls , of the cooling chamber  and, in some embodiments, can extend downwardly to the upper surface of the heat sink . The second insulating material  may be about 1 inch thick (and therefore the space between the first and second sidewalls , of the cooling chamber  and the housing  may be about 1 inch). The second insulating material  can include apertures  through which the first and second connectors ′, ′ extend.A third insulating material  can be positioned between the third and fourth sidewalls , of the cooling chamber  and the housing . The third insulating material  may be the same or different from the first insulating material  and/or the second insulating material . In some embodiments, the third insulating  material comprises foam rubber, such as polyurethane foam, foam rubber latex, and the like. The third insulating material  can be adhesively attached to the third and fourth sidewalls , of the cooling chamber . The third insulating material  can extend downwardly along the entire third and fourth sidewalls , of the cooling chamber  and, in some embodiments, can extend downwardly to the upper surface of the heat sink . The third insulating material  may be about 1 inch thick (and therefore the space between the third and fourth sidewalls , of the cooling chamber  and the housing  may be about 1 inch). The third insulating material  can include apertures (not shown) through which the first and second connectors ′, ′ may extend.is a rear perspective view of the moisture trap . A power supply box  can be attached to the housing  (in some embodiments, the box  may be integrated with the housing ). The box  can house a power adapter  () to convert AC power to DC power. For example, the adapter  may convert about 120 volts AC to about 15 volts DC. A power cord  () can supply AC power to the moisture trap . The power cord  can run into the box  to supply AC power to the adapter ; for example, the cord  may run adjacent the fan  and into the box . DC power from the power adapter  can be used to supply power to the thermoelectric device  and/or to the fan . The box  can include an aperture  to provide air to a fan  to cool the power adapter  and its associated components. The fan  may be integrated with the power adapter  or may be a separate component. The box  can include apertures ,  for additional cooling and/or air flow. The adapter  can be positioned in the box  such that it is spaced apart from the housing . This space can serve to thermally isolate the adapter  from the heat sink  and other components of the moisture trap . In some embodiments, the adapter  may be spaced at least about 0.1875 inches from the housing .Referring to , in some embodiments, there may be a gap  between the insulating material  and the housing  adjacent the power supply box . The gap  may allow air from the fan  to pass through the heat sink , up along the housing  and through apertures ,  in the housing  (). In this regard, the gap  and apertures ,  can help dissipate additional heat from the heat sink , thereby allowing for a colder cooling side of the thermoelectric device  and in turn a colder cooling chamber . Moreover, the gap  can thermally isolate the box  and the power adapter  from the heat sink  and other components of the moisture trap . Where used, the gap  will typically have a thickness of less than about 0.50 inches.As described above, the moisture trap  can include connectors ′, ′ (, A-C,  and ). The connectors ′, ′ may connect with, extend through, and/or be integrated with respective ports ,  of the cooling chamber . The connectors ′, ′ may extend outside the housing  and allow for other components or equipment to connect with the moisture trap . The housing  may include apertures  () substantially aligned with the ports ,  of the cooling chamber , with the connectors ′, ′ extending through the apertures. The connectors ′, ′ may include hose connections such as, for example, ½ inch, 7/16 inch, or ⅜ inch hose connections.The moisture trap  is configured to be used in combination with a vacuum pump and equipment from which moist air is evacuated. For example, a vessel containing a wet or moist test sample can be connected to the moisture trap  at the port  or the connector ′ and a vacuum pump can be connected to the moisture trap  at the port  or the connector ′. In some embodiments, the moisture trap  is configured to be used in combination with a vacuum pump having a flow rate of between about 40 liters per minute to about 200 liters per minute.This is illustrated in . A chamber or vessel  includes a test sample . The test sample  may be compacted asphalt or loose asphalt mixture, for example. The chamber  may include liquid  (e.g., water), which may submerge the test sample . The vessel  may include vapor  (e.g., water vapor). A fluid path  connects the chamber  and a vacuum pump . The portable moisture trap  is positioned in the fluid path . For example, the fluid path  may comprise a hose or pipe fluidly connecting the chamber  and the moisture trap  (e.g., at connector ′), and may also comprise a hose or pipe fluidly connecting the vacuum pump  and the moisture trap (e.g., at connector ′).In operation, the lid  is sealably attached to the top portion of the cooling chamber  and power is supplied to the moisture trap . Power will activate the thermoelectric device . The cooling side of the thermoelectric device  cools the cooling chamber . Heat generated by the heat generating side of the thermoelectric device is transferred to the heat sink . Heat is removed from the heat sink  using the fan . As more heat is removed from the heat sink , more heat is transferred from the heat generating side of the thermoelectric device , and as a result the temperature of the cooling side of the thermoelectric device  decreases and accordingly the temperature of the cooling chamber  also decreases.The cooling chamber  is thermally isolated from the heat generating side of the thermoelectric device  and the heat sink  by the spacer block , and by the use of insulating materials , , and . This thermal isolation allows the cooling chamber  to become increasingly cold even as the heat generating side of the thermoelectric device  and the heat sink  dissipate more and more heat.In particular, the inner and outer bottom surfaces ,  of the cooling chamber  and the sidewalls , , , of the cooling chamber  become increasingly cold after applying power to the moisture trap . After a certain amount of time, the temperature of the cooling chamber  reaches steady state. In some embodiments, the cooling chamber  reaches a steady state temperature of about 32 degrees Fahrenheit at about 70 degrees Fahrenheit ambient in less than about 15 minutes.A vacuum pump, such as the vacuum pump  illustrated in , is then operated. The vacuum pump is in fluid communication with a port of the cooling chamber , such as port . The vacuum pump is configured to evacuate moist air from equipment, such as the chamber or vessel  illustrated in . The equipment from which moist air is evacuated is in fluid communication with the opposite port of the cooling chamber , such as port .Thus, moist air is received through the port  of the cooling chamber  in response to operation of the vacuum pump. The baffle  in the interior of the cooling chamber  serves to urge the moist air down toward the inner bottom surface  of the cooling chamber  and then up before substantially dry air exits the port  of the cooling chamber . For example, the air may take a path similar to that shown by the arrow in . In this regard, the baffle serves to direct the air along the relatively cold surfaces of the cooling chamber  to enhance moisture removal. The baffle  can also encourage the air to travel proximate the first sidewall of the cooling chamber  through which the first port  extends as the air travels downward from the port  and can also encourage the air to travel proximate the sidewall of the cooling chamber  through which the second port  extends as the air travels upward toward the port .Moisture is removed from the air as it travels through the cooling chamber ; the moisture removal is enhanced by directing the air along the relatively cold surfaces of the cooling chamber . Water vapor in the air condenses and collects at the inner bottom surface  of the cooling chamber. As described above, the lid  may include an optically transparent or translucent material to allow a user to observe moisture as it gathers in the cooling chamber . After the vacuum process has been completed, the user may open the lid  and remove the moisture from the cooling chamber , such as by absorption or suction. Additionally or alternatively, an automatic or manual valve and/or a drain may be included at the bottom of the cooling chamber to allow moisture to flow therefrom.In some embodiments, a temperature sensor is placed in the interior of the cooling chamber . This can allow a user to monitor the temperature of the cooling chamber  and, for example, determine when the cooling chamber  has reached a steady state temperature. Moreover, the temperature sensor may be in communication with a controller, and the controller may also be in communication with other components (e.g., the fan , the power adapter , etc.) to regulate the temperature of the cooling chamber . The controller may be separate from the moisture trap  or may be integrated with the moisture trap . For example, the controller may be housed within the box .The moisture trap described herein can provide several advantages over traditional moisture removing devices used in these applications. The cold temperatures and directed air flow path can remove moisture more efficiently than traditional devices. In particular, desiccant dryers may be somewhat efficient when the desiccants are initially dry; however, they may quickly lose their efficiency as the desiccants inevitably become wet from moist air flowing therethrough. Accordingly, these dryers must be continually replaced or recycled, adding cost and causing downtime. Moreover, moisture can enter the vacuum pump even when these dryers are replaced or recycled regularly.Vacuum pumps employ lubricants such as oil to reduce friction between moving parts and to protect seals. Any moisture entering the vacuum pump serves to dilute the lubricant and reduce its effectiveness. As a result, any moisture entering the pump necessitates increased oil changes, which increase cost, produce waste, and create downtime. Moreover, the gradual breakdown of the lubricant during operation decreases the lifetime of the pump due to friction between parts and breakdown of seals.Furthermore, the moisture trap described herein allows for a relatively unobstructed flow path through the moisture trap. This is in contrast to other dryers such as desiccant dryers, which can create considerably more resistance. The vacuum pump must work harder and requires more power input due to increased flow resistance.The moisture trap described herein can improve the efficiency of the vacuum pump in another way: the pressure is reduced inside the cooling chamber as moisture is condensed. This creates an increased pressure gradient between the equipment to be evacuated (e.g., chamber or vessel containing moist air) and the vacuum pump, thereby increasing the efficiency of the pump.The moisture trap can also provide an environmentally-friendly solution. Its enhanced moisture removing capabilities and relatively unobstructed air flow path can reduce the power consumption of the vacuum pump. The reduction of moisture entering the pump also increases the lifetime of the pump, therefore eliminating waste created by disposing of the pump unnecessarily early. Along the same lines, the reduction in moisture entering the vacuum pump reduces the number of required oil changes, which create oil waste that is difficult to dispose and harmful to the environment.As described above, the configuration of the moisture trap also allows for a lightweight, portable solution. In some embodiments, the footprint of the moisture trap is less than about 100 square inches, and in other embodiments less than about 88 square inches. In some embodiments, the moisture trap weighs less than about 10 pounds, and in other embodiments weighs less than about 8 pounds.The moisture trap is suitable to be used in laboratory applications, such as the testing of compacted and loose paving mixtures. The lightweight and portable nature of the moisture trap allow for easy manipulation and movement required in these environments. Moreover, the connectors/ports of the moisture trap can allow for easy connection of components such as vacuum pumps and vessels.The moisture trap is also configured to be operated continuously, thereby improving the accuracy, reliability and repeatability of tests. This is in contrast to other dryers, such as desiccant dryers, that need constant replacement, increasing downtime and potentially compromising repeatability of test conditions.The moisture trap can be used in systems designed to dry compacted asphalt samples for testing, such as the systems disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2005/0102851 to He et al., the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety. In particular, the moisture trap  can be positioned between a chamber containing an initially wet compacted asphalt sample and a vacuum pump configured to evacuate moist air from the chamber. In some embodiments, the sample in the chamber is exposed to alternating cycles of applied vacuum and ambient or heated air to keep the sample at a relatively constant temperature. For example, the chamber may include two ports, with vacuum being applied through one port and ambient air supplied through another port. At least during the vacuum cycle, the moisture trap  can prevent moist air evacuated from the chamber from entering the vacuum pump. In these systems, the cycling can continue until the pressure in the chamber is less than 10 TORR, which indicates that the compacted asphalt sample is dry.The moisture trap  can also be used in the testing of loose asphalt mixtures. For example, the moisture trap can be used in tests for determining maximum specific gravity and density of bituminous paving mixtures. These tests are described in ASTM Test D2041 and AASHTO Test T209, the disclosures of each of which are incorporated herein in their entireties. Vacuum pumps are used in these tests to reduce the pressure in a vessel containing a test sample submerged in water (the vacuum pump is also used to remove air from the sample). The tests require the use of one or more 1000 mL filter flasks, or the equivalent, installed between the vessel and the vacuum pump to reduce the amount of water vapor entering the pump. Current practice is to use one or more desiccant dryers; however, these dryers have several drawbacks as detailed above.illustrates operations for determining the maximum specific gravity or density of a test sample using a portable moisture trap. A portable moisture trap in a fluid path connecting a vessel adapted to hold a test sample and a vacuum pump is provided (Block ). The portable moisture trap includes a cooling chamber having a first port connected to the vessel and a second port connected to the vacuum pump. The portable moisture trap also includes a thermoelectric device. In some embodiments, the portable moisture trap can include other components described above in reference to the moisture trap . The cooling chamber is cooled using the thermoelectric device (Block ). The test sample is weighed to determine a dry mass of the sample (Block ). Subsequently, the test sample is placed in the vessel (Block ). Water is added to the vessel to submerge the test sample (Block ).Moist air is evacuated from the vessel while the test sample is submerged and the pressure in the vessel is reduced using the vacuum pump. This evacuating step can be carried out by the following: flowing moist air from the vessel through the first port of the cooling chamber (Block ); then removing moisture from the moist air in the cooling chamber (Block ); and then flowing substantially dry air through the second port of the cooling chamber toward the vacuum pump (Block ). In some embodiments, the cooling chamber includes a baffle extending downwardly in the cooling chamber from a location proximate a lid to a location proximate an inner bottom surface of the cooling chamber, and the step of removing moisture (Block ) includes urging moist air down toward the inner bottom surface of the cooling chamber. In some embodiments, the baffle comprises a plate that extends across the cooling chamber and contacts opposing corners or sidewalls so that the first port is on one side of the plate and the second port is on the other side of the plate, wherein the plate has a bottom edge with alternating downward projections and valleys that resides proximate the inner bottom surface of the cooling chamber, and the step of removing moisture (Block ) includes flowing moist air through the valleys of the baffle.Subsequently, the volume of the sample is determined (Block ). In some embodiments, the step of determining the volume of the sample includes: submerging the vessel with the test sample in a water bath; and determining an underwater weight of the test sample. In some other embodiments, the step of determining the volume of the sample includes: filling a known volume vessel with the sample and water; and weighing the filled vessel in air.Finally, the density and/or specific gravity of the test sample is calculated using the determined dry mass and the determined volume of the sample (Block ). The density is calculated by dividing the dry mass by the volume. The maximum specific gravity is the ratio of the mass of the sample to the mass of an equal volume of water.The foregoing is illustrative of the present invention and is not to be construed as limiting thereof.
