US20120134749A1,05-31-2012,Using noble gas geochemistry to evaluate fluid migration in hydrocarbon bearing black shales,"American energy costs steadily increase leading to increased unconventional energy use. However, scientific barriers prevent widespread and economic development of these resources. In gas shale plays, resource utilization is limited by the understanding of how hydrocarbons and other fluids migrate in fractured rock. This limits industry's ability to extract hydrocarbons with enhanced recovery methods; prevents exploration in areas where hydrocarbons do not collect in traditional traps; and could unfortunately lead to dangerous environmental consequences such as contaminated groundwater. To address these concerns, the present invention integrates geochemical and geostructural techniques in a novel method for evaluating and optimizing the placement and drilling strategies of extraction wells in hydrocarbon rich black shales. By correctly choosing hydrocarbon “sweet spots” companies can reduce the number of unprofitable wells, choose directional drilling and completion strategies to accurately reflect the subsurface, and better select prime small- and full-field reservoirs."

US20130091925A1,04-18-2013,Method for Determining the Genetic Fingerpring of Hydrocarbons and Other Geological Fluids using Noble Gas Geochemistry,"Black shales differ from conventional gas plays in that in most cases there exists minimal geological scale gas migration. Thus, it is difficult to perform accurate reservoir characterization using classic geophysical and geological techniques (i.e. seismic analysis, gravity anomalies, structural geology, etc.).

In the presence of noise, motion, and imaging artifacts, these methods can be prone to producing physically and/or biologically implausible tensor estimates. The exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure can address at least this deficiency by formulating an exemplary estimation problem, e.g., as linearly constrained linear LS, where the constraints can ensure acceptable tensor estimates."

Fuel bubbles up through the sphere's base and is positioned using computer guided piezoelectric transducers that are located outside the blast-chamber. These generate phase-shifted standing-waves that tractor the bubble to the center. Once there, powerful acoustic compression waves are launched.

Warm blooded animals transmit a large amount of electromagnetic energy that can be reflected for thermotherapy. Using reflected electromagnetic energy from existing sources eliminates the need for a power supply, infrared lights, and cords. The problem is that in our modern energized world broad spectrum ambient and available transmitted electromagnetic energy from source may be contaminated with extra bandwidths of the full electromagnetic spectrum. This broad-spectrum energy when reflected onto a patient target can make the patient feel uncomfortably warm and produce undesirable effects. A variety of reflector coatings are available that can limit the spectra reflected back to a target from a broad spectra source. Gold finishes or tailored ceramic finishes are examples of spectral limiting coatings. When a gold reflector matrix is used, the spectral reflectance characteristics of gold limits the reflected energy to the infrared bandwidths. This reduces the hyperthermic discomfort of the patient target and allows the patient target to be treated with desired therapeutic infrared bandwidths for a much longer period of time. The gold reflector matrix can be attached to a fabric substrate. Once attached the substrate fabric, the resulting composite can be used to make a variety of apparatus.
